The reason for me making this extension was because I asked my mom what extension she wanted and as a graphic artist she said: "maybe change all of the images to narwalls."
That's a great idea. Because aren't you sick of waking up in the morning hopping on a news website and seeing all these depressing images, instead you will get a plethera of narwalls 
happy and cute.
